**Creating index.mdx page**

The user asked me to create a simple index.mdx page titled "Welcome." The project is currently empty, so I need to establish this page in the root content directory. I’ll include frontmatter with the title, a description, and an icon. The essential content should be an H1 heading and maybe a brief welcome text afterward. It seems like I’ll call a function to create the file, including the proper setup for the frontmatter.

**Setting up index.mdx**

I’m planning to create the index.mdx page with specific content. I’ll set the frontmatter with a title, a refined description saying, "Welcome to the docs," and an icon. For the main content, I’ll include an H1 heading that simply says "Welcome." So, I’ll make a call to create this file and ensure everything is formatted correctly. It seems straightforward, but I want to make sure it’s done right!
