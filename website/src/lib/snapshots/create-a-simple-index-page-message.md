````md reasoning
I need to address an issue: the tool has been rejected due to an invalid icon labeled 'home'. To fix this, I should fetch the list of valid icons before trying again. I’ll use functions.fetchUrl to grab the available icons from https://fumabase.com/lucide-icons.json. There's no need for multi_tool use here, so I'll just call fetchUrl and then check the response to see what icons I have to work with.

**Choosing a valid icon**

I'm realizing that I need to select a valid icon for my task. The 'home' icon isn't available, but I see that 'house' is an option. So, my plan is to use the 'house' icon instead. I'll go ahead and recreate the file with this choice. To make the changes, I’ll call the function for replacing the editor and create the file again with the new icon. Seems clear enough!
