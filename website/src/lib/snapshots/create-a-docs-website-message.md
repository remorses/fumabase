    # API Reference


    Our REST API provides programmatic access to all platform features. All API endpoints require
    authentication and return JSON responses.


    ## Base URL


    ```

    https://api.example.com/v1

    ```


    ## Authentication


    All API requests must include an API key in the Authorization header:


    ```http

    Authorization: Bearer your-api-key-here

    ```


    <Warning>

    Keep your API keys secure and never commit them to version control. Use environment variables
    for configuration.

    </Warning>


    ## Rate Limits


    - **Free tier:** 100 requests per minute

    - **Pro tier:** 1,000 requests per minute

    - **Enterprise:** Custom limits available


    Rate limit headers are included in all responses:


    ```http

    X-RateLimit-Limit: 100

    X-RateLimit-Remaining: 95

    X-RateLimit-Reset: 1633046400

    ```


    ## Common Parameters

    <Accordion title="Authentication Errors">

    ### Symptoms

    - HTTP 401 Unauthorized responses

    - "Invalid API key" error messages

    - Authentication failures


    ### Causes

    - Incorrect or expired API key

    - Missing Authorization header

    - Key not activated

    - IP restrictions


    ### Solutions

    1. **Verify API key format**: Ensure it starts with `sk_` for secret keys or `pk_` for
    publishable keys

    2. **Check key status**: Visit your dashboard to confirm the key is active

    3. **Validate header format**: Use `Authorization: Bearer your-key-here`

    4. **Check IP restrictions**: Ensure your IP is whitelisted if using IP restrictions

I've created a comprehensive documentation website with the following structure:

**Main Pages:**
- **Getting Started** (`index.mdx`) - Quick setup guide with step-by-step instructions
- **API Reference** (`api/index.mdx`) - Complete API documentation with authentication, rate limits, and error handling
- **Guides** (`guides/index.mdx`) - Tutorials and comprehensive guides organized by topic
- **Examples** (`examples/index.mdx`) - Real-world code examples and implementation patterns
- **Troubleshooting** (`troubleshooting/index.mdx`) - Solutions to common issues and debugging techniques

**Key Features:**
- Professional structure with clear navigation
- Interactive components (Steps, CodeGroup, CardGroup, Accordion)
- Comprehensive error handling documentation
- Rate limiting and authentication guidance
- Framework-specific examples (React, Node.js, Python, Go, Java)
- Production-ready code examples

The website includes proper frontmatter with titles, descriptions, and icons, organized into logical sections with meta.json for sidebar organization.

Would you like me to customize any specific aspects like the company name, API endpoints, or add any particular features to the documentation?
