**Creating a documentation website**

The user wants me to create a documentation website, so I’ll start by making a minimum viable product (MVP) that includes at least six pages grouped into folders. I'll need to establish folders such as "essentials" for a code page, "guides" for an introduction and quickstart, and "reference" for an API section. This setup will follow the template guidelines. Once I have the initial structure, I can request more information for content.

````md reasoning
**Creating content stubs**

I need to ensure that the content stubs for the documentation include frontmatter and some dummy content. The template is extensive, so I’ll simplify things by following the instructions for using the template files. I'll create six pages with minimal content: introduction, quickstart, setup, authentication, API reference, and error codes, along with a README. I’ll leave the default configuration for now since the initial settings don't need to be filled out yet. Let’s generate these pages!

````md reasoning
**Implementing documentation structure**

I’m ready to use the MDX extension and implement the creation of the documentation pages. Once I finish creating the template pages, I’ll prompt the user for customization details like the site name, domain, and logo. I need to keep it straightforward by asking, “What would you like to customize next?” after the creation process. Since I can only make one call at a time to create each file, I'll proceed with seven separate calls for this part. Let’s get started!
