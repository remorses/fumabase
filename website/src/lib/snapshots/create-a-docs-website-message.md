    # Fumabase Starter Kit


    ### Development


    ## 1. Install the Fumabase CLI


    To preview your documentation changes locally, first install the [Fumabase
    CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fumabase). Use the following command:


    ```

    npm i -g fumabase

    ```


    ## 2. Start the Local Development Server


    At the root of your documentation project (where `fumabase.jsonc` is located), start the
    development server with:


    ```

    fumabase dev

    ```


    ### Publishing Changes


    ## 3. Set Up Automatic Deployments


    Install our GitHub App to enable automated deployments from your repository. After pushing
    changes to your default branch, your documentation will be deployed to production automatically.
    You can find the installation link on your dashboard.

    ### Code Block


    Use [fenced code blocks](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks) by
    enclosing code in three backticks and follow the leading ticks with the programming language of
    your snippet to get syntax highlighting. Optionally, you can also write the name of your code
    after the programming language.

    ### Using Markdown


    The [markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#images) lets you add images
    using the following code


    ```md

    ![title](/path/image.jpg)

    ```


    Note that the image file size must be less than 5MB. Otherwise, we recommend hosting on a
    service like [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) or [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). You can
    then use that URL and embed.


    ### Using Embeds


    To get more customizability with images, you can also use [embeds](/writing-content/embed) to
    add images


    ```html

    <img height="200" src="/path/image.jpg" />

    ### Subtitles


    Best use to subsection headers.

    <Tip>


    Each **title** and **subtitle** creates an anchor and also shows up on the table of contents on
    the right.


    </Tip>


    ## Text Formatting


    We support most markdown formatting. Simply add `**`, `_`, or `~` around text to format it.


    | Style         | How to write it   | Result          |

    | ------------- | ----------------- | --------------- |

    | Bold          | `**bold**`        | **bold**        |

    | Italic        | `_italic_`        | _italic_        |

    | Strikethrough | `~strikethrough~` | ~strikethrough~ |


    You can combine these. For example, write `**_bold and italic_**` to get **_bold and italic_**
    text.


    You need to use HTML to write superscript and subscript text. That is, add `<sup>` or `<sub>`
    around your text.

    Accessible documentation isn't just about compliance—it creates better experiences for all users
    by prioritizing clarity, structure, and multiple ways to consume information.


    ## Clear Language and Structure


    Accessible writing starts with clear, direct language that reduces cognitive load for all
    readers.


    ### Write for Clarity


    Use simple, direct language that communicates efficiently:


    <CodeGroup>

    ```markdown ❌ Complex Language

    Subsequently, in order to implement the aforementioned functionality,

    it is necessary to instantiate the configuration object with the

    appropriate parameters as delineated in the following example.

    Next, create a configuration object with these settings:

    Great documentation isn't just about having the right information—it's about organizing that
    information so users can find and understand it quickly.


    ## Start with User Intent


    Before writing a single word, understand what your users are trying to accomplish. Are they
    trying to solve a problem, learn a concept, or complete a task?


    <Tip>

    Always lead with the outcome. Tell users what they'll achieve before explaining how to do it.

**Fixing MDX Compilation Error**

I'm seeing that one of the create calls failed due to an MDX compilation error in the writing/user-focused.mdx file. The strReplaceEditor returned an error related to an unexpected closing tag, which likely happened because of a nested code fence and Steps tag mismatch. It seems I need to fix that file, but I don’t have a view function to check it. However, I can use strReplaceEditor with the "view" command to locate the issue. After viewing the file, I'll make the necessary edits.

    ## Understanding User Intent


    Before documenting any feature, understand the jobs users are trying to do. Documentation should

    ## Write for Different Experience Levels


    Lead with the simplest path that works, then provide advanced options for power users. Always
    include a short quick-start that gets users running in minutes.

  # User-Focused Documentation


  The best documentation doesn't just explain features—it helps users accomplish their goals. Focus
  on outcomes, not just functionality.


  ## Understanding User Intent


  Before documenting any feature, understand the jobs users are trying to do. Documentation should
  bridge the gap between what users want to achieve and how your product helps them get there.


  ## Write for Different Experience Levels


  Lead with the simplest path that works, then provide advanced options for power users. Always
  include a short quick-start that gets users running in minutes.


  ### Quick Start Example


  ```javascript

  import { EmailAPI } from '@company/sdk';

  const client = new EmailAPI('your-api-key');

  await client.send({
    to: 'user@example.com',
    subject: 'Hello World',
    html: '<h1>It works!</h1>'
  });

  ```
