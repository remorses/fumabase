````md reasoning
**Updating page frontmatter**

The user wants to add icons to all pages, which suggests that there are existing pages that need updating. However, it seems we haven't created any pages yet, based on our earlier reasoning. As I review the instructions, we need to form a draft website structure and create templates for those pages. Knowing the filenames for the pages listed, such as essentials/code.mdx and README.md, will be essential for implementing the changes the user requested.
````


````md reasoning
**Adding icons to frontmatter**

It seems like the project has a content folder, specifically with directories like "essentials" and "writing," along with a README.md file. I understand we need to edit the frontmatter for each .mdx file and the README.md, since all documentation pages require YAML frontmatter. Each page will need an icon from the lucide list. For instance, I could assign icons like "code" for code.mdx and "file-text" for frontmatter.mdx. I also want to choose appropriate icons for each page, ensuring they are meaningful and visually aligned.
````


````md reasoning
**Updating README.md frontmatter**

The README.md file needs frontmatter added, including the title "Fumabase Starter Kit," a description, and an icon. Since it’s treated as the site root page, we’ll enhance its frontmatter accordingly. For all .mdx files, I'll need to add an icon field to their frontmatter, specifically after the description. Since there are about ten files, I’ll run sequential updates to insert icons properly. I must check each file and ensure I’m inserting the icons correctly, which might take a bit of time and careful attention.

output:

  error: 'Page not found for path: essentials/code.mdx'

````

````md reasoning
**Realizing project needs**

I'm examining the paths and think the content might differ, like "essentials/code.mdx" or "content/essentials/code.mdx." The template suggests the page files are relative to the content folder, but since the project's empty root only has fumabase.jsonc, I realize we haven't actually created any pages yet. The assumption that pages exist was wrong. So, before we can add icons as the user requested, we need to create those pages first—let's prioritize that!
````


````md reasoning
**Creating necessary pages**

I’ve realized we haven’t actually created any pages yet. Before I can add icons, I need to generate those pages using the template. The user wants icons on all pages, but that can only happen after the pages exist. So, my next step is to create those essential pages, focusing on code, accessibility, and user-centered design. I’ll start with a simple structure: home, installation, quickstart, guides, API, and reference, ensuring everything’s ready before adding icons. Let’s get to it!
````


````md reasoning
**Proposing page structure**

I'm proposing a structure for the pages that the user wants, each with an icon. I’ll create these files: 

1. **index.mdx** with a home icon.
2. **getting-started.mdx** with a rocket icon.
3. **installation.mdx** featuring a download icon.
4. **concepts/overview.mdx** having a book icon.
5. **api/reference.mdx** with a code icon.
6. **examples/usage.mdx** marked with a play icon.

I'll assign these icons in the frontmatter during creation to meet user expectations. Finally, I’ll implement the six create commands to generate all these pages. Let’s get started with the index page!
