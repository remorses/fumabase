**Fetching icons for frontmatter**

I see that I have five .mdx files where I need to add an icon field to the frontmatter. Before I can do that, I must fetch the list of icons. I'll go ahead and retrieve the lucide icons JSON using the appropriate function. This way, I'll have the necessary icons to set for each page. Let's get started with that!

**Updating file content**

I’m thinking about how we need to update each file. I’ll use the function to view the content of the files first. Starting with `index.mdx`, I want to make sure I can see the frontmatter at the top. Then, I’ll perform the string replacement to include the icon line. It's crucial that I get the frontmatter correct, so I'll take this step-by-step to avoid mistakes. Let's make sure everything is in order!

**Updating frontmatter**

I need to add an icon to the frontmatter, which currently just includes the title. The required icon is "house." Per the tool's instructions, the frontmatter should be in a YAML block at the top, but it doesn't seem to enforce having a description—only the title and icon are needed. So, I'll just add the icon line while keeping the rest unchanged. I’ll format the new block correctly with valid YAML syntax to include the icon.
