## Reasoning

**Creating API documentation structure**

The user requested to create API documentation with endpoints for users and products. Since this is a new site from scratch, I'll focus on building an MVP documentation site that includes pages like an overview and a quickstart guide. I need to structure it by creating a root README, a quickstart page, and an "api" folder that contains pages for "users" and "products." Additionally, I might add an overview page as an index in this folder.

## Reasoning

**Structuring API documentation**

Since the user wants API documentation, it’s possible to create an OpenAPI spec file, but I could also write the pages manually. It might be best to have pages like api/users.mdx and api/products.mdx for clarity. I’ll need to include at least six pages, so I'll add authentication and errors pages. The final structure will consist of an index overview, a quickstart guide, and the API documentation pages. I’ll also create a README.md for the root.

## Reasoning

**Drafting API documentation pages**

I’m planning to create seven pages for the API documentation, including authentication, users, products, errors, a quickstart guide, and an overview index. I need to adjust the project settings afterward, but my main focus is on drafting these pages. 

Each page will include specific sections with details like prerequisites for using the API, examples for making requests, and comprehensive explanations for each endpoint. I’ll implement the creation of the files next.

  # Quickstart

  ## Prerequisites

  - API Key (create one in your dashboard)
  - HTTP client (curl, Postman, or any HTTP library)

  ## First Request

  Use the following curl command to list users:

  ```bash
  curl -X GET "https://api.example.com/v1/users" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
  ```

  <Check>
  You should receive a 200 response with a list of users.

  # Authentication


  We use API keys to authenticate requests. Include your key in the
  Authorization header.


  ## Obtain API Key


  Generate or find your API key in the user dashboard under **API Settings**.


  ## Authorization Header


  All requests require the header:


  ```

  Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY

  ```


  ## Example


  <CodeGroup>

  ```bash curl

  curl -X GET "https://api.example.com/v1/users" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc"
  ```

  ```http

  GET /v1/users HTTP/1.1

  Host: api.example.com

  Authorization: Bearer sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc

  ```
