**Creating API documentation structure**

The user asks me to create API documentation with endpoints for users and products. Since the project is empty, I need to scaffold an MVP documentation website right away. It’s clear I should set up the initial structure, which will include a content folder and pages. I’ll create an "api" folder with pages for "users" and "products," along with an index page. I want to include basic metadata and a README to describe the site and endpoints.

````md reasoning
**Expanding API documentation structure**

I can scaffold more by including CRUD endpoints for Users and Products — specifically list, get, create, update, and delete. This means I’ll have two pages under the "api" folder: users.mdx and products.mdx. I might want to add quickstart.md and authentication.md. To meet the six-page requirement, I'll include index, quickstart, authentication, api/users, api/products, and maybe a page for error codes. After creating these, I’ll ask the user for additional details if needed. I’ll outline my pages clearly to follow the guidelines.

````md reasoning
**Implementing API documentation pages**

I’ll create the api/users.mdx file with metadata like the title "Users API" and a description of the endpoints for user-related actions like creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting. The endpoints will include GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods.

Next, I’ll prepare a similar page for products.mdx and set up the index page titled "API Reference," which will link to these subpages. I’ll also add a quickstart.mdx page for getting started, along with an authentication.mdx page and an faq.mdx for error codes. That gives me a solid six pages. Let's organize everything with the necessary directories!
