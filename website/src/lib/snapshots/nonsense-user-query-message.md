````md reasoning
**Planning documentation structure**

I think the best approach is to start with the existing project's empty state. Since there's likely just one file, fumabase.jsonc, I should focus on what documentation to include. However, the user input feels nonsensical, like "adsf". I need to bootstrap by creating an initial skeleton structure. I could generate six placeholder pages with a note saying "TBD." Instead, I might create one README.md that links to those pages, asking the user for additional information as we go.
````


````md reasoning
**Generating initial pages**

Next, I need to generate pages based on the user's input. Although the plan requires creating pages first, I'll start by making six files, beginning with README.md and getting-started/index.mdx. I’ll do this through sequential calls. There’s some confusion around whether I can send multiple files in one call since the instructions seem to indicate separate files, but I want to ensure the user has a scaffold. After the initial files, I can prompt the user for further details.

````md reasoning
**Creating scaffold and seeking input**

The user might feel bored, so I'm thinking about producing just the initial README.md and index.mdx first, then asking for topics. But the instructions say to gather more information after creating the pages. I could generate a skeleton and then ask, "I've scaffolded six pages. What topics should be prioritized?" I’ll make six create calls in the commentary section and keep the final message simple, just asking for areas to expand or customize. Let’s implement that.
