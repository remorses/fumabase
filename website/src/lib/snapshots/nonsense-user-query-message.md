````md reasoning
**Preparing template creation**

I see that the template includes several pages, and I can create multiple files from it. Since the tool expects JSON input, I’ll keep my responses concise—no more than four lines each. After creating the files, I’ll ask the user for more information as instructed. I’ll be using multi_tool_use.parallel to run the creation commands for about 8-10 files. Each command will need the path and file text, ensuring the frontmatter is included as well.
````


````md reasoning
**Creating content files**

I need to ensure I'm wrapping markdown content or code correctly in ```mdx or ```md for internal output. However, the final user output must be concise and free of extra explanations. I’ll prepare commands for the files listed in my template, which include essentials/code.mdx, essentials/frontmatter.mdx, essentials/images.mdx, essentials/markdown.mdx, README.md, writing/accessibility.mdx, writing/code-examples.mdx, and writing/content-structure.mdx—so that's 8 pages in total. I’ll set up the multi_tool_use.parallel call with the necessary parameters for each file creation.
````


````md reasoning
**Final response after tool call**

After the tool call, I need to respond concisely, just one or two lines. The instructions say I should ask the user for more information to customize the site after creating the template pages. So, I’ll respond with something like, "I created an initial docs site with sample pages. What would you like to customize?" but I need to keep it short. Then I’ll proceed to call multi_tool_use.parallel.

    ### Inline Code


    To denote a `word` or `phrase` as code, enclose it in backticks (`).


    ```

    To denote a `word` or `phrase` as code, enclose it in backticks (`).

    ```


    ### Code Block


    Use [fenced code blocks](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks) by
    enclosing code in three backticks and follow the leading ticks with the programming language of
    your snippet to get syntax highlighting. Optionally, you can also write the name of your code
    after the programming language.


    ```java HelloWorld.java

    class HelloWorld {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("Hello, World!");

    ### Using Markdown


    The [markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#images) lets you add images
    using the following code


    ```md

    ![title](/path/image.jpg)

    ```


    Note that the image file size must be less than 5MB. Otherwise, we recommend hosting on a
    service like [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) or [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). You can
    then use that URL and embed.


    ### Using Embeds


    To get more customizability with images, you can also use [embeds](/writing-content/embed) to
    add images


    ```html

    <img height="200" src="/path/image.jpg" />

    ```

    ### Subtitles


    Best use to subsection headers.

    <Tip>


    Each **title** and **subtitle** creates an anchor and also shows up on the table of contents on
    the right.


    </Tip>


    ## Text Formatting


    We support most markdown formatting. Simply add `**`, `_`, or `~` around text to format it.


    | Style         | How to write it   | Result          |

    | ------------- | ----------------- | --------------- |

    | Bold          | `**bold**`        | **bold**        |

    | Italic        | `_italic_`        | _italic_        |

    | Strikethrough | `~strikethrough~` | ~strikethrough~ |


    You can combine these. For example, write `**_bold and italic_**` to get **_bold and italic_**
    text.


    You need to use HTML to write superscript and subscript text. That is, add `<sup>` or `<sub>`
    around your text.

    # Writing Accessible Documentation


    Accessible documentation isn't just about compliance—it creates better experiences for all users
    by prioritizing clarity, structure, and multiple ways to consume information.


    ## Clear Language and Structure


    Accessible writing starts with clear, direct language that reduces cognitive load for all
    readers.


    ### Write for Clarity


    Use simple, direct language that communicates efficiently:


    <CodeGroup>

    ```markdown ❌ Complex Language

    Subsequently, in order to implement the aforementioned functionality,

    it is necessary to instantiate the configuration object with the

    appropriate parameters as delineated in the following example.

    ```


    ```markdown ✅ Clear Language

    Next, create a configuration object with these settings:

    ```

    # Writing Effective Code Examples


    Code examples are often the first thing developers look for in documentation. Make them count by
    ensuring they're accurate, complete, and genuinely helpful.


    ## Complete and Runnable Examples


    Never show partial code that won't work in isolation. Users should be able to copy your example
    and see it work immediately.


    <CodeGroup>

    ```javascript ❌ Incomplete

    // Don't do this - missing imports and setup

    const user = await getUser(userId);

    updateProfile(user.id, { name: 'John' });

    ```


    ```javascript ✅ Complete

    // Do this - everything needed to run

    import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';


    const prisma = new PrismaClient();


    async function updateUserProfile(userId, updates) {

    # Content Structure That Works


    Great documentation isn't just about having the right information—it's about organizing that
    information so users can find and understand it quickly.


    ## Start with User Intent


    Before writing a single word, understand what your users are trying to accomplish. Are they
    trying to solve a problem, learn a concept, or complete a task?


    <Tip>

    Always lead with the outcome. Tell users what they'll achieve before explaining how to do it.

    </Tip>


    ### The Inverted Pyramid Approach


    Structure your content like a news article—most important information first, supporting details
    after.

    <Step title="Lead with the outcome">
        Start each section by describing what the user will accomplish or learn.
