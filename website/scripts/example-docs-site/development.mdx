<Info>
  **Prerequisite**: Please install Node.js (version 19 or higher) before proceeding. <br />
  Please upgrade to ```docs.json``` before proceeding and delete the legacy ```mint.json``` file.
</Info>

Follow these steps to install and run Fumabase on your operating system:

**Step 1**: Install Fumabase:

<CodeGroup>

  ```bash npm
  npm i -g fumabase
  ```

```bash yarn
yarn global add fumabase
```

</CodeGroup>

**Step 2**: Navigate to the docs directory (where the `docs.json` file is located) and execute the following command:

```bash
fumabase dev
```

A local preview of your documentation will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Custom Ports

By default, Fumabase uses port 3000. You can customize the port Fumabase runs on by using the `--port` flag. To run Fumabase on port 3333, for instance, use this command:

```bash
fumabase dev --port 3333
```

If you attempt to run Fumabase on a port that's already in use, it will use the next available port:

```md
Port 3000 is already in use. Trying 3001 instead.
```

## Fumabase Versions

Please note that each CLI release is associated with a specific version of Fumabase. If your local website doesn't align with the production version, please update the CLI:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g fumabase@latest
```

```bash yarn
yarn global upgrade fumabase
```

</CodeGroup>

## Validating Links

The CLI can assist with validating reference links made in your documentation. To identify any broken links, use the following command:

```bash
fumabase broken-links
```

## Deployment

<Tip>
  Unlimited editors available under the [Pro
  Plan](https://fumabase.com/pricing) and above.
</Tip>

If the deployment is successful, you should see the following:

<Frame>

</Frame>

## Code Formatting

We suggest using extensions on your IDE to recognize and format MDX. If you're a VSCode user, consider the [MDX VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx) for syntax highlighting, and [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) for code formatting.
