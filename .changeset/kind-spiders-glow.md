'docs-website': patch

Add hideSidebar option to docs configuration schema to allow hiding the sidebar completely. When enabled, this option removes the sidebar from the documentation layout and adjusts the page width accordingly. This is useful for documentation sites that prefer a full-width layout or use alternative navigation patterns.
