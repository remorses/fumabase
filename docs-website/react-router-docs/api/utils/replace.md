## Example

A `replace` redirect is useful in situations where you want to prevent the user from navigating back to the page they were redirected from. For example, after a user logs in, you wouldn't want them to be able to click "back" and return to the login form.

Here is an example of an `action` that processes a login form. Upon a successful login, it uses `replace` to redirect to the dashboard:

```tsx
import { replace } from "react-router-dom";
import { login } from "./auth";

export async function action({ request }) {
  const formData = await request.formData();
  const user = await login(formData);

  if (user) {
    // If login is successful, redirect to the dashboard
    // by replacing the current `/login` entry in the
    // history stack. This prevents the user from
    // clicking the back button and returning to the
    // login page.
    return replace("/dashboard");
  }

  // Handle login error
  return { error: "Invalid credentials" };
}
```
