# Accessibility in Documentation

Accessibility ensures that everyone—including people with disabilities—can use, understand, and benefit from your documentation. By following accessibility best practices, you make your docs more usable for all readers and compliant with legal and ethical standards.

<Info>
This guide covers essential accessibility principles and actionable steps to create inclusive, user-friendly documentation.

## Core Accessibility Principles

Follow the four main principles of accessibility (POUR):

- **Perceivable**: Content must be presented in ways users can perceive (e.g., text alternatives for images).
- **Operable**: All interface components and navigation must be usable with a keyboard and assistive technologies.
- **Understandable**: Information and operation of the interface must be clear and predictable.
- **Robust**: Content must be compatible with current and future user tools, including screen readers.

## Writing Accessible Content

<Steps>
<Step title="Use clear, direct language">
    Write in short, simple sentences. Avoid jargon or explain it when necessary.
</Step>
<Step title="Structure with headings">
    Use a logical heading hierarchy (H2, H3, etc.) to organize content. This helps screen readers and improves navigation.
</Step>
<Step title="Use lists and tables accessibly">
    - Use bulleted or numbered lists for steps and options.
    - For tables, include header rows and use simple structures.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Visual Accessibility

- **Color contrast**: Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background. Use the provided CSS variables for color customization.
- **Images and alt text**: Always provide descriptive `alt` text for images. For decorative images, use empty alt text (`alt=""`).
- **Avoid color-only cues**: Do not rely solely on color to convey information. Use icons, labels, or patterns as well.

<Frame caption="Example: Accessible image with descriptive alt text">
<img src="/images/fumadocs.jpeg" alt="Fumadocs logo on a white background" />
</Frame>

## Interactive and Code Accessibility

- **Keyboard navigation**: Ensure all interactive elements (links, buttons, accordions) are accessible via keyboard (Tab, Enter, Space).
- **Accessible code blocks**: Use proper language tags for syntax highlighting. Provide copy buttons and clear error handling in examples.
- **ARIA and semantic markup**: Use semantic HTML and ARIA attributes where needed to improve screen reader support.

## Testing and Verification

- Use automated tools like Axe, Lighthouse, or WAVE to check for common accessibility issues.
- Manually test with keyboard navigation and screen readers (e.g., NVDA, VoiceOver).

- **Low contrast**: Adjust colors using CSS variables for better readability.
- **Missing alt text**: Add descriptive alt text to all images.
- **Improper heading order**: Review and correct heading levels.
- **Unlabeled buttons or links**: Add clear, descriptive labels.
